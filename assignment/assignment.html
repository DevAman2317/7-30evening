      <p> The founder of the Maratha dynasty in India, Chatrapati Shivaji is regarded as one of the most valiant warriors who dared to stand up against the mighty Mughals, and defeated them several times. The murder of Khan with tiger paws is a story for the history textbooks, the story of an immensely brave and clever tactician who stopped at nothing to protect his Maratha empire from Mughal invasion. He was crowned in 1674 and assumed the title of Haindava Dharmodharak, and Chhatrapati. He formed the first Hindavi Swarajya, which accounted for the complete Hindu rule.</p>
